<h1>👩‍💻WIT (Women In Tech) Meeting point👩‍💻</h1>

**WIT meeting point** is the Final project for Technigo bootcamp Spring 2021. Developed by <a href="https://github.com/ThereseHag">Therese Hagelin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/esteficodes">Estefanía Quevedo</a>.

This project is the result of our strong wish to see more diversity in the tech industry. According to Women in tech statistics for 2020, a whopping 80% of those in the tech field are still male, while only 20% are female. We dream of a society full of tech workplaces in which women and other minorities are not outnumbered by men anymore. With our application we wish to contribute by offering an evergrowing list of resources specially aimed for women who wish to start building a career in technology. We have built a database of over 70 websites, bootcamps, schools, courses, articles, books and others which focus on bringing more women and girls into the tech industry.
