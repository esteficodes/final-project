              WIT Meeting point is the place where you can find all kinds of
              resources aimed for women who are interested in starting their
              journey into the tech world. Find websites, communities, schools,
              bootcamps and much more! According to Women in tech statistics for
              2020, a whopping 80% of those in the tech field are still male,
              while only 20% are female. We dream of a society full of tech
              workplaces in which women and other minorities are not outnumbered
              by men anymore. Do you share this dream? Join us!
